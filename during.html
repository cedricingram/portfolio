        <h2>First Getting There</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_0775.jpg" alt="airport ceiling"/>
        <p>
            After the 8-hour flight we arrived in Madrid, Spain. The first thing I noticed was the look of the airport. 
            The ceiling was wooden, with yellow steel trim. It was unlike any airport I had ever seen. It made the 
            feeling of being in another country like I was in another world. So many people were there too. It was an 
            expansive, open space. As soon as we landed we were on the move to get to the places we would be staying. 
            We would actually be living in Salamanca, Spain which is about a two-hour drive from the airport.
        </p>
        <h2>The City</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_0829.jpg" alt="people walking in a city"/>
        <p>
            The city itself was so cool to see because there was a mix between history and modernity. It was the 800th 
            Anniversary of the University of Salamanca so the city seemed lively because of it. When we first got there 
            it was kind of cold. In fahrenheit, it went down to about 40° during the first week. But it quickly picked 
            up to about 85° towards the end of the month. Many people walked around the city to get places. For us, most 
            of the places we needed to get to was about 10-15min. walk so it wasn’t that bad. The architecture was 
            beautiful. It was the gothic style I always remembered seeing in the textbooks. The people there were nice 
            and family-oriented, you almost always saw people with their family.
        </p>
        <h2>Typical Day</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_0781.JPG" alt="Salamanca, Spain Snapchat filter"/>
        <p>
            During the week we had classes from 8am-1:30pm. Around 1:30 was the time siesta started, which was a couple 
            hours time where the city took a break as a whole and many businesses closed for a couple hours before 
            resuming the rest of the day. I would go back to my dormitory and take a nap before going back out because 
            we all had to be under the clock at La Plaza Mayor by 4pm. From there we would usually have our evening 
            programming where we would go see different sites and do activities to get more familiar with the rich 
            culture Spain has. On the weekends, we had an excursion on Saturday, Sunday would be a rest/free day to 
            explore or do whatever we chose, with optional excursions as well.
