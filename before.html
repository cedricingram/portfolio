    <h2>Application Process</h2>
    <p>
        Back in 2018, I was a 22 year-old student attending Grand Rapids Community College (GRCC) in my hometown of 
        Grand Rapids, Michigan. I was also a member and Peer Mentor for GRCC TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) 
        Program, a federally funded program that aimed to assist first generation low-income college students. Over the 
        previous year, my advisors kept encouraging me to apply to the Council of Opportunity in Education (COE) Keith 
        Sherin Global Leaders Program, a summer-semester study abroad program open for TRIO students nation-wide. Being 
        the reserved, cautious and timid person I was, I didn’t know if I wanted to go through the process of applying 
        just to be told no. And in the case I do get chosen, how would I pay for it? But with a month before the 
        deadline, I decided to take a chance on myself and apply. It was a long month, but after many long nights and 
        multiple revisions of application essays, I was finally ready to submit and wait for my fate.
    </p>
    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    <p>
        About a couple weeks after I submitted the application, I was in the TRIO office. One of my advisors had called 
        me over. They were reading off of an email they had just received. It was an email from COE saying I had gotten 
        accepted to the program! All the doubt I had and the fear of letting myself and others around me down went away 
        with that email. I was so excited about the news I froze. Everything this means to me and to the people who 
        care for me and want to see me do great things and earn what I work hard for. It would be my first time 
        traveling outside of the country (for context, Toronto is a 6-hour drive from my hometown), and for it to be in 
        another continent as well was cool to me. A little later I found out my friend who had also applied had gotten 
        in. What are the odds 2 of the 24 students selected nation-wide to participate would be both of us?! It was such 
        a great day for myself and everyone in the office. But soon reality started to set in? How am I going to get 
        there? What do I need to bring with me? What things do I need to do to prepare? How am I going to pay for this?
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        Part of the cool thing about the COE Keith Sherin Global Leaders Program was it paid for around half of the 
        total cost for the month-long study abroad program. The total cost was $5,000. COE paid for half, so that still 
        left me with trying to figure out where to get $2,500 from. My way of doing it was: scholarships. With the help 
        of my advisors I was able to find multiple scholarship opportunities, and I was awarded enough to cover the cost 
        of the program. The only thing I had to worry about was having money to survive when I was there. As time got 
        closer to June, when I would be leaving, more information about the logistics of traveling to Spain and the 
        program itself came out. Luckily for me, my advisors had sent students off to the program before so they were 
        able to help tell me what to expect. Two tasks I specifically remember having to do was send them a picture for 
        what would be my student ID, and to get a TB test. I remember the picture being awkward because the picture was 
        a selfie. Not like the typical professional photos you take on the first day of school. Getting and sending my 
        TB test results were the most difficult because I had to figure out where to get it done for a cheap price. I 
        couldn’t get it through insurance, and most of the places I found were in no way cheap, time was getting closer 
        for me to turn it in. Luckily, I was able to find an urgent care center that did it for a somewhat reasonable 
        price. To get to Spain I first had to get to New York because that’s where I was supposed to be meeting the rest 
        of the cohort and the program leaders, and from New York we would be flying to Spain. My friend and I decided to 
        travel together, it made the most sense and we could look out for each other. Fast forward to making it to New 
        York. It was my first time in the city. It was HUGE! We got a ride to the hotel we would be spending the night 
        in and meeting the other students. We had dinner with all of us at the hotel. It was so cool to get to meet 
        everyone there. People from California, Texas, Puerto Rico, and other places. We bonded almost instantly. The 
        next day we were on our way to the airport waiting to start our journey to Spain.
