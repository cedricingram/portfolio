                Studying abroad in Salamanca taught me so much, not only about the city and Spain, but also about myself. I
                learned that I want to explore the world. Getting the taste of traveling makes me want to do it more. I also
                want to go back and live in Europe. It’s a place I can see myself living in for the rest of my life. I learned
                that the best way to learn a new language is to do so by only speaking that language. I learned of new
                perspectives, different cultures and customs, new ways of learning.

                I am currently a student at the University of Michigan studying Information Science. I will be graduating in
                December of 2020. I also work in a student-led social innovation incubator and  organization called optiMize.
                The work I do there involves helping build bridges for students transferring to the University of Michigan to
                make their transition as smooth and seamless as possible. Reaching out to students at community colleges and
                helping run programs for transfer students once they arrive at the university.

            <h2 class="el7">Hopes For The Future</h2>
            <img class="el8" src="images/globe.jpg" alt="close-up of a world map globe"/>
            <p class="el9">
                I hope that after graduation I’ll be able to find work in Europe. My biggest goal is to move to Europe and work
                as a User Experience (UX) Designer. My current dream destinations are Barcelona, Spain and Amsterdam,
                Netherlands. I would also like to work within the music industry if at all possible. I believe there is much to
                be done when it comes to UX of music sites and applications. Dealing with how to organize music and music
                instruments in a clear and concise way is a challenge I’m willing to face. I also want to encourage other
                students to study abroad, especially those from my alma mater Grand Rapids Community College. Studying abroad
                opened my eyes to all the opportunities I could have and widened my perspective on life and what excites me. I
                want other students to get that chance.
